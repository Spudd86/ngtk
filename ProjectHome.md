# NGTK - A Cross-Platform "Native" Gui Tool-Kit #
This academical project aims for creating a simple Gui Toolkit which uses "native" widgets where possible, and with many different back-ends. It has absolutely no dependencies of it's own, and it will only depend on the libraries of the backend you choose.

The idea is to deliver a simple Gui toolkit that will have enough back-ends that each common platform will be sure to have one without installing any additional libraries.

This library is **still in development** and it is written as a part of the _Advanced Topics in Operating Systems_ course given at my university.

## Backends ##

  * NCURSES (Terminal Gui) - **Release 1.0 goals finished!** Release 2.0 goals 75% finished.
  * Windows (Using Windows Api) - **Release 1.0 goals finished!**
  * X11 - **Release1 goals finished!** Release 2.0 goals 75% finished.
  * Gtk+ (On whatever platform Gtk+ works) - planned for future
